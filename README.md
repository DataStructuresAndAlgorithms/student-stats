## About this project

Before taking CS111 I wanted to learn some of the basics of Java, so I made this project that is an attempt at making a student roster.

After taking CS111 I realized how I could've approached this project in a much better, more OOP way. Although I used Java, in retrospect I can see how this project is way too verbose.
